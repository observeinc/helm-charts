# Components

## node-logs-metrics

This service is a *daemonset* which means it runs on every node in the cluster. It is responsible for collecting logs from pods that are running on the node. In addition, it scrapes the API of the kubelet running on the node for metrics about the node and the pods running on the node.

## cluster-events

This service is a *single-instance deployment*. It's critical that this service is only a single instance since otherwise it would produce duplicate data. It is responsible for both scraping for Kubernetes events on startup as well as registering as a listener for any new Kubernetes events produced by the cluster. These events are then transformed and become the basis for the representation of all the resources in your Kubernetes cluster as well as any events that happen on those resources.

## cluster-metrics

This service is a *single-instance deployment*. It's critical that this service is only a single instance since otherwise it would produce duplicate data. It is responsible for pulling metrics from the Kubernetes API server and sending them to Observe.

## prometheus-scraper

This service is a *single-instance deployment*. It's critical that this service is only a single instance since otherwise it would produce duplicate data. It is responsible for scraping pods for Prometheus metrics is configured and runs.

## forwarder

This service is a *daemonset* which means it runs on every node in the cluster. It is responsible for receiving telemetry from the other services, specifically via an OTLP receiver and forwarding it to Observe. It can be used as the target for various instrumentation SDK's and clients as well. See [here](https://docs.observeinc.com/en/latest/content/observe-agent/ConfigureApplicationInstrumentation.html) for more details.

## monitor

This service is a *single-instance deployment*. It's critical that this service is only a single instance since otherwise it would produce duplicate data. It is responsible for monitoring the other containers of Observe Agent running by scraping the exposed Prometheus metrics of those agents. It's best practice to separate the monitoring of the agents from the agents themselves since if problems develop in those pipelines, we would need the agent telemetry to keep flowing in order to diagnose.

## fargate-collector

This service is an *OpenTelemetryCollector*, a custom resource that is managed by a OpenTelemetry Operator (must be installed separately) It is responsible for collecting metrics from nodes when running on AWS Fargate. It injects a sidecar into every pod with the appropriate annotation, and scrapes the API of the kubelet of that node for metrics. Daemonsets are not allowed on fargate, so this service is intended as a replacement for the usual approach for node metric collection with the `node-logs-metrics` daemonset.
